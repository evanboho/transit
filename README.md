TransIt: time to get around
===========================

TransIt is a service that provides realtime departure times for public transportation in the Bay Area.

From the web or mobile browser, a transit rider—or transiteer—can find their station by navigating through the agency, route, and stop.

For other developers, there is an API that translates the 511 and NextBus APIs from XML to cross-site-available JSON.
